<h3 class="enhancer-section">Target audience</h3>

<p>
  The event's goal is to connect research IT specialists: experts who empower research by providing specific, advanced IT services.
</p>
<p>
  Examples include research software engineers, high-performance and scientific computing experts, data and information scientists,
  as well as research data management experts, data stewards and data analysis specialists in Swiss higher education institutions, Swiss research institutions
  and private companies that have a focus on serving public academic institutions (e.g. SWITCH).
</p>

<h3 class="enhancer-section">Keynote speakers</h3>

<p><b>Mark Wilkinson</b> is the lead author of the primary FAIR Data Principles paper, and lead author on the first paper describing a complete implementation of those principles over legacy data.</p>

<p>He is a founding member of the FAIR Metrics working group, tasked with defining the precise, measurable behaviours that FAIR resources should exhibit,
  and the author of the first software application capable of a fully-automated and objective evaluation of “FAIRness”.</p>

<p><b>Lars Holm Nielsen</b> is Head of Open Science Repositories at CERN IT where he leads Open Science services and projects for large-scale scholarly repositories.
  He built and grew Zenodo.org from a proof of concept to being the world's largest general-purpose research repository supporting researchers around the world in any discipline to share and preserve their research products.
  He further leads the 25 partners InvenioRDM open source repository platform, helping institutions and domains to provide Open Science services.</p>

<p>He has pioneered innovative solutions across research domains for research software citations as well as unlocking FAIR biodiversity data.
  He's work focuses on providing core enabling infrastructure for Open Science to help accelerate scientific discovery and ultimately improve how science is conducted.</p>

<h3 class="enhancer-section">Organizers</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.enhancer.ch/">EnhanceR association</a> is a nationally and internationally recognized network for Swiss research IT expertise. As of 2024, it counts 10 Swiss higher education, infrastructure and research institutions as members.
